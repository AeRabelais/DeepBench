# SimplePhysicalImage

Simulation library for very simple simulations to benchmark machine learning algorithms.

## General Features
	1. very fast to generate
	2. Mimics in a very basic / toy way what is in astro images
	3. Be fully controllable parametrically

## Planned Features
1. Kinds of data to mimic
		1. Strong lenses: Arcs, circles
		2. Supernovae: light curves
		3. Quasars: Skewed Sine wave
		4. N-body simulations: Points in 2D and 3D and in lightcones
		5. Galaxy clusters: Optical - points and 2d kernels; SZ - blurred circles; X-ray - blurred circles
		6. Spectra (stellar, galactic)
		7. Noise: photon, psf
2. Dimensions of data
		1. point / graph
		2. 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D (space-time), 6D (phase space)
		3. Shapes: Polygons, Circles, squares, Polyhedrons, Spheres, cubes
3. Top Data Sets for Initial Release:
		1. Strong lenses
		2. Light curves

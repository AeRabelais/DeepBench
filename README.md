# SimplePhysicalImage

### What is it?
Simulation library for very simple simulations to benchmark machine learning algorithms.

### Why do we need it? Why is it useful?
1. There are very universally recognized scientifically meaningful benchmark data sets, or methods with which to generate them.
2. A very simple data set will have objects, patterns, and signals that are intuitively quanitifiable and will be fast to generate.
3. A very simple data set will be a great testing ground for new networks and for newcomers to practice with the technology.

## Requirements
1. python 3.x
2. matplotlib

## General Features
1. very fast to generate
2. Mimics in a very basic / toy way what is in astro images
3. Be fully controllable parametrically

## Planned Features
1. Kinds of data to mimic
	1. Strong lenses: Arcs, circles
	2. Supernovae: light curves
	3. Quasars: Skewed Sine wave
	4. N-body simulations: Points in 2D and 3D and in lightcones
	5. Galaxy clusters: Optical - points and 2d kernels; SZ - blurred circles; X-ray - blurred circles
	6. Spectra (stellar, galactic)
	7. Noise: photon, psf
2. Dimensions of data
	1. point / graph
	2. 1D, 2D, 3D, 4D (space-time), 6D (phase space)
	3. Shapes: Polygons, Circles, squares, Polyhedrons, Spheres, cubes
3. Top Data Sets for Initial Release:
	1. Strong lenses
	2. Light curves
